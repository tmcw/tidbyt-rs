personalized tidbyt display

This is the code that runs [my Tidbyt display](https://macwright.com/2023/10/29/tidbyt-rs). It's written in
Rust, for fun. This is probably not the easiest way to implement anything.

Right now it shows:

- Runs, from Strava
- Mail, from Fastmail
- The temperature and UV, from NOAA

It might be useful example code for doing some of those things, like getting
an email count from a JMAP API like Fastmail's.
